# React Boilerplate

   This is my boilerplate React app. It allows me to just dive in and start building a project without having to worry about all the things that don't change much from one app to next, at least for me. Tooling includes:
   - [Redux](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux)
      - Redux isn't always necessary, but I usually use it anyway because we use it at work and this helps me keep learning. I may make a boilerplate without Redux in the future.
   - [Redux Thunk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-thunk)
   - [Styled Components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/styled-components)
      - I find this much easier than trying to manage style sheets.
   - [esm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/esm)
      - Allows me to write ES6 modules on the backend.
